# SmithChart
This is a SmithChart App That I made for Dr. Horne It is based on the App found at https://github.com/cemulate/smith-chart


This App implements paper.js javascript. 

known bugs are that, When Launching the App, it occasionally Causes the Smith chart to load incorrectly in terms of scaling.

When updating the app, you may recieve an error depending on the version of Jquery in which you utilize. For new comers to this, I've pasted (below), The Improvement that I made. I had to decrease the version of Jquery to version 1.9.1 Which matches the Version from the original app found at cemulate/smith-chart
